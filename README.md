## How to transfer the dump from the device to the pc

You can use AirDrop or [LocalSend](https://github.com/localsend/localsend) to transfer dump to any device within local network.

## Adding or updating a game in the dumper

Follow the prototype in [GameProfiles](Tweak/src/UE/UEGameProfiles)<br/>
You can also use the provided patterns to find GUObjectArray, GNames or NamePoolData.

## Building

This requires THEOS to be installed on Mac:

```bash
xcode-select --install
brew install perl git ldid make clang

mkdir -p ~/software
cd ~/software
git clone --recursive https://github.com/theos/theos.git
echo 'export THEOS=~/software/theos' >> ~/.zshrc
```

Then:
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
cd iOS_UEDumper/Tweak
make clean package
# replace the following IP address with the local network address from
# your iPhone device (192.168.2.25)
scp ./packages/com.kitty.uedumper_4.0.1_iphoneos-arm.deb root@192.168.2.25:/var/tmp/

```
